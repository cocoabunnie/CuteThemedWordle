# ☁️ CuteThemedWordle ☁️

This is my version of the game Wordle. It's the same game, but with a very cute, soft, pink theme. I love the game Wordle, and I've seen many versions of it, but I haven't seen a version that's pink, so I made this one! I will most likely publish it online, and when I do I'll post the link here, however I'm still adding more words and features to it, but that will come soon! 🥰

The main game is on the main branch. But each branch is meant to show different iterations of my process. 

### "Base_Game" Branch 🍄✨
This branch shows the "skeleton" or the basic parts of the game. This is the game without any styling or colors other than the green and yellow labels for letters.

### "Styling" Branch 💖🎨
This branch basically shows the game, but after I added styling to it. This can also be considered as the "polished" version
