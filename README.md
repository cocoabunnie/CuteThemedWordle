# ☁️ CuteThemedWordle ☁️

This is my version of the game Wordle. It's the same game, but with a very cute, soft, pink theme. I love the game Wordle, and I've seen many versions of it, but I haven't seen a version that's pink, so I made this one! 

I will most likely publish it online, and when I do I'll post the link here, however I'm still adding more words and features to it.

### How To Play

The goal of the game is to guess the 5 letter word in 6 tries or less. As you guess, you'll get hints as to which letters belong to the word, which letters are in the right place, and which letters don't belong in the word all together. 

Type in a word, and press submit. 

If the letter turns gray, it means the letter is not in the word you're trying to guess.

If the letter turns yellow, it means the letter is in the word, but it's not in the right spot.

If the letter turns gree, that means you have that letter in the correct spot.

The goal is the game is to turn all 5 letters in a row green, meaning you've guessed the word correctly, in 6 tries or less.

The main game is on the main branch. But each branch is meant to show different iterations of my process. 

### "Base_Game" Branch 🍄✨
This branch shows the "skeleton" or the basic parts of the game. This is the game without any styling or colors other than the green and yellow labels for letters.

### "Styling" Branch 💖🎨
This branch basically shows the game, but after I added styling to it. This can also be considered as the "polished" version

Feel free to play it as much as you like, and have fun! ♥️
