# ☁️ CuteThemedWordle ☁️

This is my version of the game Wordle. It's the same game, but with a very cute, soft, pink theme.

The main game is on the main branch. But each branch is meant to show different iterations of my process. 

### "Base_Game" Branch 🍄✨
This branch shows the "skeleton" or the basic parts of the game. This is the game without any styling or colors other than the green and yellow labels for letters.

### "Styling" Branch 💖🎨
This branch basically shows the game, but after I added styling to it. This can also be considered as the "polished" version
